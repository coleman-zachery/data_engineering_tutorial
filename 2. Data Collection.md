# 2. Introduction to Data Collection

In this section, we will explore the foundational aspects of data collection, including understanding different types of data sources and basic techniques for extracting data. Data collection is a critical first step in the data engineering process, as it provides the raw material necessary for analysis and decision-making.

## Understanding Data Sources

Data can come from a variety of sources, each with its own characteristics and use cases. Understanding these sources is essential for designing effective data collection strategies.

### Structured vs. Unstructured Data

- **Structured Data**: 
  - Organized into predefined formats such as tables, rows, and columns.
  - Examples include databases, spreadsheets, and CSV files.
  - Easily searchable and analyzable using SQL and other querying languages.

- **Unstructured Data**: 
  - Lacks a predefined structure or format.
  - Examples include text documents, images, videos, and social media posts.
  - Requires specialized tools and techniques for processing and analysis, such as natural language processing (NLP) and image recognition.

### Common Data Sources

- **APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)**:
  - Enable data access and interaction with external systems and services.
  - Commonly used for accessing web services, social media data, and public datasets.
  - Often provide data in JSON or XML format.

- **Databases**:
  - Centralized repositories for storing structured data.
  - Include relational databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) and NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra).

- **File Systems**:
  - Store data in files and directories on local or networked drives.
  - Include formats like CSV, Excel, JSON, XML, and text files.

## Data Extraction

Data extraction involves retrieving data from various sources for further processing and analysis. Here are two common methods for data extraction:

### Web Scraping Basics

- **Definition**: Web scraping is the process of automatically extracting data from websites.
- **Tools and Libraries**: 
  - **BeautifulSoup**: A Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents.
  - **Scrapy**: An open-source web crawling framework for Python.
  - **Selenium**: A tool for automating web browsers, often used for dynamic content extraction.

- **Basic Steps**:
  1. Identify the target website and the data to be extracted.
  2. Inspect the website's HTML structure to locate the desired data.
  3. Use a web scraping tool to extract the data.
  4. Store the extracted data in a structured format for further analysis.

- **Considerations**:
  - Ensure compliance with the website's terms of service and robots.txt file.
  - Be mindful of ethical and legal implications when scraping data.

### Using APIs for Data Extraction

- **Definition**: APIs provide a standardized way to access and interact with data from external systems.
- **Common API Types**:
  - **REST (Representational State Transfer)**: Uses HTTP requests to access and manipulate resources.
  - **GraphQL**: Allows clients to specify the structure of the required data, reducing over-fetching.

- **Basic Steps**:
  1. Obtain API access credentials (e.g., API key, OAuth token).
  2. Review the API documentation to understand available endpoints and data formats.
  3. Use an HTTP client (e.g., `requests` library in Python) to make API requests and retrieve data.
  4. Parse the returned data (usually in JSON or XML format) for further processing.

- **Considerations**:
  - Be aware of API rate limits and usage policies.
  - Handle errors and exceptions gracefully when making API requests.

### Summary

Data collection is a foundational step in data engineering that involves understanding various data sources and employing techniques for extracting data. By mastering these skills, data engineers can ensure that high-quality data is available for downstream processes.

In the next section, we will explore data transformation and processing, focusing on techniques for cleaning, transforming, and preparing data for analysis.
